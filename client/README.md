# NSS CHARUSAT Client

This is the frontend client application for the NSS CHARUSAT project.

## Security Improvements Made

### 1. Console Log Removal
- Removed all `console.log` statements from the codebase
- Commented out debug console.error statements
- Cleaned up any remaining debugging code

### 2. Data Leak Prevention

- Updated `LoginPage.jsx` to use `process.env.REACT_APP_DASHBOARD_URL`
- Updated `EventPage.jsx` to use `process.env.REACT_APP_DRIVE_LINK`
- Removed any hardcoded API endpoints

### 3. Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the client directory with the following variables:
```
REACT_APP_DASHBOARD_URL=http://localhost:8080/
REACT_APP_DRIVE_LINK=https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zbPXPL_5Eh6O0j4-vXirgdYDpAgVHX0T

```
